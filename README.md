Alas, poor man; is the celestial glory of so little esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth running the hazard of a few difficulties to obtain it?

How highly should we prize the Bible! And how patiently and prayerfully should we search the Scriptures, that we may not err and die forever!

(新改訳２０１７）ローマ人８：５－６
肉に従う者は肉に属することを考えますが、御霊に従う者は御霊に属することを考えます。
肉の思いは死ですが、御霊の思いはいのちと平安です。

Rom 8:5  For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 
Rom 8:6  For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
